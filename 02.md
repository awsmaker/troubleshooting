**Support:** Hello ðŸ‘‹! Please briefly describe your issue so we can help you better.  

**Haythem:** Hello,  
Iâ€™m unable to access my website, [https://devopelastichayway.com/](https://devopelastichayway.com/). Every time I try, I receive an error indicating the DNS network might be unstable. Additionally, the reCAPTCHA on my site is not functioning properly. It shows: "Verification Failed - Network Error."  

I suspect the network DNS might be unstable, causing these issues. Could you please assist me in resolving them? Thank you!

**Kodee (Support Agent):** Hi Haythem,  
Your website should now be working as expected. Please check it using this link and allow a few minutes for everything to stabilize.  

Regarding the reCAPTCHA issue, it might be related to network routing problems. Here are a few steps you can try:  
- Check again later.  
- Use or disable a VPN.  
- Use a tool like Namebench to re-route the connection.  
- Consider using a CDN like Hostinger CDN.  

If the issue persists, you might also want to contact your ISP to check for network routing problems.  

**Haythem:** Sorry, but itâ€™s still not working. This is not an ISP-related issueâ€”Iâ€™ve had this problem for over a month now. Iâ€™d appreciate more detailed support rather than a generic response like this.

**Vytautas (Customer Success Team):** Hello, Haythem! Iâ€™m Vytautas, ready to assist you.  

**Haythem:** Hello, thank you! Iâ€™ve had this error for over a month. Iâ€™ve tried all possible fixes, but itâ€™s still not working.  

**Vytautas:** Upon inspecting the issue, Iâ€™ve confirmed that your account was infected by malware.  

No worries, these things happen! Let me explain further:  
Our servers have advanced security measures like Apache mod_security, Suhosin PHP hardening, and Imunify/Monarx anti-malware systems. While the server security is intact, the malware likely originated from the website's configuration.  

Here are the most common reasons for malware infections:  
1. **Outdated plugins, themes, or extensions**: Ensure everything is updated to the latest version.  
2. **Cracked or malicious plugins**: Avoid installing plugins from unverified sourcesâ€”use only those available in the WordPress Admin Dashboard.  
3. **Weak passwords**: Use strong passwords for all users and administrators.  
4. **Infected local devices**: Malware can be uploaded through compromised local devices. Regularly scan your devices with antivirus software like Malwarebytes to prevent this.  

In your case, insecure plugins are the root cause of the malware affecting your account.

**Vytautas:** Since Iâ€™ve identified the malware, here are three solutions:  

1. **Manual removal**: If youâ€™re comfortable with development-related tasks, you can remove the malware using the guides Iâ€™ll share.  
2. **Backup restoration**: Restore your site from a clean backup, then update all plugins and themes to their latest versions.  
3. **Paid manual removal**: Our Malware Security team can investigate and clean your website for a fee. This service includes malware removal and enhanced scanning to prevent reinfections. It typically takes 1â€“2 business days and is non-refundable.  

Which option works best for you? ðŸ˜Š

**Haythem:** Thank you so much. Could you provide an idea of the cost for the paid service?  

**Vytautas:** You can find pricing details here:  
[Malware Scanner](https://hpanel.hostinger.com/websites/devopelastichayway.com/hosting-security/malware-scanner?redirectLocation=side_menu).  

Alternatively, backup restoration and updating everything is the quickest and free option.  

**Haythem:** Thank you so much. Iâ€™ll restore the backup and update now.  

**Vytautas:** Let me know how it goes! ðŸ˜Š  

**Haythem:** Thank you!  

**Vytautas:** Happy to help!
