05:01 PM | Haythem Rehouma: Hello, 
 I‚Äôm unable to access my website, [https://devopelastichayway.com/](https://devopelastichayway.com/). Every time I try, I receive an error message indicating that the DNS network might be unstable. Additionally, the reCAPTCHA on my site is not functioning properly. Verification Failed - Network Error 
 The network DNS might be unstable, causing errors. 
 To fix this:
Press Windows Icon Windows + R.
Press CTRL + V
Press Enter. 
 Could you please assist me in resolving these issues? 
 Thank you!

05:03 PM | Kodee from Hostinger: Hi Haythem, your website should now be working as expected. Please check it using this link (https://devopelastichayway.com/?1735570993) and allow a few minutes for everything to stabilize. 
 Regarding the reCAPTCHA issue, it might be related to network routing problems. You can try the following steps: check again later, use or disable a VPN, use Namebench to re-route the connection, or consider using a CDN like Hostinger CDN. If issues persist, contact your ISP to change your network routing.

05:23 PM | Haythem Rehouma: sorry it is still not working, it's not a problem of ISP

05:24 PM | Haythem Rehouma: I have this problem for more than one month

05:24 PM | Haythem Rehouma: I need more careful support rather than giving me a generic answer like this generated by IA

05:25 PM | Kodee from Hostinger: I've made another adjustment to fix the error preventing your website from working. Please visit your website using this link (https://devopelastichayway.com/?1735572310) and allow a few minutes for everything to stabilize. Let me know if it still doesn't work!

05:25 PM | Kodee from Hostinger: I‚Äôm now connecting you with our Customer Success Team for further help. A specialist will join us soon and will have access to our chat history, so you don‚Äôt need to repeat anything unless you want to add more details.

05:25 PM | Vytautas from Hostinger: Hello! It's Vytautas here, I'm ready to assist you.

05:28 PM | Vytautas from Hostinger: Upon inspecting the issue, I can confirm your account was infected by malware.

 No worries, these things happen ‚Äì let me explain a little more about it ‚¨áÔ∏è 
‚ÄãÔªø
ÔªøPlease be sure it's not related to server security. Our servers have advanced security modules (such as Apache mod_security, Suhosin PHP hardening, PHP open_basedir protection, and others). ÔªøOne of the newest implementations is anti-malware security Imunify and Monarx.
‚ÄãÔªø
ÔªøI would like to kindly list out the most common reasons for an infected website (malware):
‚ÄãÔªø 
 - Outdated plugins/themes/extensions. It's crucial to ensure all the used plugins, themes, and extensions are updated to the latest version (https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-update-wordpress#How_to_Update_WordPress_Themes_and_Plugins). 
- Cracked / malicious plugins. Malware can easily infect cracked plugins, which are downloaded on the web and prone to various malicious injections. We recommend installing plugins from the WordPress Admin Dashboard only. 
- Weak user/administrator passwords. Ensuring that all users have strong passwords will significantly increase security. 
- Infected local computer. Malware can get uploaded directly with the file uploads to your Hostinger account File Manager as well. For this reason, guard your device, make sure to update antivirus software, and scan your computer for viruses regularly (Malwarebytes (https://www.malwarebytes.com/)). Here's how you can also protect your computer ‚Äì Learn about malware and how to protect all your devices against it (https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/what-is-malware-and-how-to-protect-against-it). 
 In your case, the specific insecure plugins are the cause for the malware reaching your account:

05:29 PM | Vytautas from Hostinger: Since I was able to identify the malware, I‚Äôd like to propose three solutions: 
 Manual removal of malware on your end ‚Äì removing a malware infection from your WordPress website requires changes of development nature. You can try to remove the malware infection from your website with the guides that will be shared below. 
 
 Backup restoration ‚Äì and afterwards all plugin/theme update:
‚Äã 
 [App: Article Inserter] 
 
 Alternatively, our Malware Security team can investigate & clean up your website by submitting a paid manual malware removal request for each infected website. While the issue cannot be guaranteed to be solved permanently, our dedicated team will inspect the malware infection, clean it out, and enhance the malware scanner to prevent malware reinfections later on. This checkup requires 1-2 business day. Please note that the paid malware removal service is non-refundable. 
 
 Let me know which option sounds best for you, I‚Äôll gladly help you with either one üòä

05:32 PM | Haythem Rehouma: Thank you so much.

05:32 PM | Haythem Rehouma: May I have an idea about the price ?

05:34 PM | Vytautas from Hostinger: You can find the option here:
https://hpanel.hostinger.com/websites/devopelastichayway.com/hosting-security/malware-scanner?redirectLocation=side_menu 
 [Image "image.png?expires=1735579800&signature=71fb1f82d56b3af00e188bfec1c81b16adf761e48a31db11c0506a074bb76b3e&req=dSMmE8B8mYBdXvMW1HO4zcf3%2FxS%2BY%2Bvxp9E8UYxP3oSB9rVpJns5WAHgMJhj%0AjOIOzg5OyogxJjHEmkg%3D%0A"] Backup restoration and then updating everything to secure your site is the quickest option to consider, it is also free.
